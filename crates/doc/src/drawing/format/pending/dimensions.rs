//! Drawings save their dimensions (`dimensions`, #4896 W19b): each on one of the drawing's views,
//! measuring named corners or edges of the view's model (a linear distance, an edge's length, an
//! angle, or a circle's or an arc's radius or diameter), with how far its line sits from them and
//! where its text sits on paper, its decimals and any text shown instead of its number. An older
//! drawing has no dimensions. The last release refuses a drawing saved with them, as a newer
//! format.
